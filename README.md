#README

Here is the VS Code theme that I use in all the time. I like dark themes so it's dark :)

I took inspiration from the Community Material and the Dark+ Material themes.

💥 If you like this theme and would like to support me making cool stuff on here, you can sponsor me on <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/FaisalKhan-8/dashboard">GitHub!</a>.

Will be maintaining this as I have time, thanks for your understanding! 🙏🏽
